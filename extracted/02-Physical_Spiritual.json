It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.  It is sown a physical body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body.  Thus it is written, \"The first man, Adam, became a living being\"; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.  But it is not the spiritual that is first, but the physical, and then the spiritual.  The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven.",

If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body.  Thus it is written, \"The first man, Adam, became a living being\"; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.  But it is not the spiritual that is first, but the physical, and then the spiritual.  The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven.",
