This was to demonstrate His righteousness, because in the forbearance of God He passed over the sins previously committed; 26 for the demonstration, I say, of His righteousness at the present time, so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. 27 Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith. 28For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law. 29 Or is God the God of Jews only? Is He not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, 30 since indeed God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith is one. 31 Do we then nullify the Law through faith? May it never be!

                  "Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering, as though something strange were happening to you. 13 But rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed. 14 If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. 15 If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal, or even as a meddler.16 However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name. 17 For it is time for judgment to begin with the family of God; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God? 18 And,  “If it is hard for the righteous to be saved,  what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?”",
                  "Hebrews 10:23Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful; 24 and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, 25 not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near. 26 For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, 27 but a terrifying expectation of judgment and the fury of a fire which will consume the adversaries."

Under grace, those in Christ are expected to perform work as a slave to righteousness, but you are given help  - Christ the vine-keeper fertilizes and massages the soil. You are expected to eventually produce fruit. Under grace, failing to produce fruit is not a direct equation resulting in death – as the parable implies, death or fire could eventually result but not right away because Christ is interceding. This is why it is called “grace and faith” – The law of faith is the grace. Under Moral and Commandment Law, violations cause sin which causes death. Therefore the world is dead because of sin which is the infection that kills all of humanity due to a guilty conscience. The Church is never infected with sin due to Christ but members can still potentially die from a lack of effort/fruit. Therefore we work out our salvation with fear and trembling, not because of a fear of sin, but fear of living up to responsibility in the vineyard. There are many instances one can shirk the responsibility of being a slave to righteousness, for example, by ceasing to eat the spiritual meal (communion) which would eventually cause a death...again not because of sin but because weakness due to starvation. Those in Christ never sin once they are born of Him (1 John 5:18). This is why Church members should not fear sin but should fear judgment because “anything is permissible, but not everything is beneficial.” Only under grace can that statement be true.",

                  "Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that everymouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God. 20 Therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of sin. 21 But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. 22 This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference, 23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. 25 God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate his justice, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished— 26 he did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.  27 Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. On what principle? On that of observing the law? No, but on that of faith. 28 For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from observing the law. 29 Is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too?  Yes, of Gentiles too, 30 since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcisedthrough that same faith. 31 Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.",
